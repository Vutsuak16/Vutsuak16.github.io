Elasticsearch Logstash and Kibana popularly abbreviated as ELK is a modern data aggregation, data querying and data visualization tool.
All the compnents of the ELK stack are seamlessly integrated for working coherently. ELK stack is fast gaining popularity and is being adopted by
corporate conglomerates too. It has a simple setting up process and even simpler learning curve. I will introduce in brief the three components of ELK stack.


### Elasticsearch

It can be used both as a command line application as well as a module

*command line*


![command]( {{'/assets/images/command.PNG' | prepend: site.baseurl }})


*as a module import*



![module]({{'/assets/images/script.PNG' | prepend: site.baseurl }})


### Integration with Jupyter/Ipyhon

 Cool stuff is that timeit is build into both Jupyter and Ipython as a magic function. 
 It can be executed by using the simple *%* operator.


![module]({{'/assets/images/ipython.PNG' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
