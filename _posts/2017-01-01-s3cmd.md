Amazon S3 is a web service offered by Amazon. It comes under the header of Amazon Web Services(AWS). Amazon S3 has become a widely used Data Storage medium because of its reasonably cost and ease of use. 
It is widely used by corporates and startups. The data is stored in S3 objects called *buckets*. To play around with the contents of S3 buckets, we have *s3cmd*, a very useful command line tool, that allows us to interact directly and securely with the contents in our S3 buckets.
It supports various operations like delete, fetch, upload etc.
