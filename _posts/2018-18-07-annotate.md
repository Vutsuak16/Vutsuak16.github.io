Data visualization is an essential part of a data scientist's job. Visualizing data helps the viewer find complex patterns in the data. Sometimes just graphs
like pie charts and bar charts do the jobs but sometimes one does feel a need of annotating data points. You may stumble upon cases where data points are very close to each other in such situations it becomes annotating data  (signifying data points with text) illegible. To make annotation even more clear and prettier we can use [adjust_text](https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText ) an amazing library I found while rummaging cool ways to annotate data.

### Binary Search that returns the best position

```python
def binary_search(val,l):

	start=0
	end=len(l)-1
	mid=(start+end/2)

	while start<=end:

		if val==l[mid]:
			return mid
			break
		elif val<l[mid]:
			end=mid-1
		else:
			start=mid+1

		mid= (start+end)/2

	return mid+1
```


### The insertion sort algorithm sans the comparisons

```python
def binary_insertion_sort(l):

	for i in range(1,len(l)):

		key=l[i]
		insert_pos=binary_search(key,l[:i])
		
		for j in range(i,insert_pos,-1):
			l[j],l[j-1]=l[j-1],l[j]
```
